# Crowdfunding Back End
Jessica Keating

## Planning:
### Concept/Name
**LightUp** is a crowdfunding platform for community groups, schools, theatres, and event organisers to raise funds for lighting, sound, and stage production needs.  
Campaigns are focused, short-term, and tangible. Such as hiring stage lights, microphones, or projectors for a specific event.

### Intended Audience/User Stories
**Intended Audience**
- Community theatre groups needing lighting or sound hire
- School production teams seeking help for AV equipment
- Local event organisers raising funds for staging or effects
- Supporters wanting to directly contribute to creative, local events

**User Stories**
1. As a **visitor**, I want to view open fundraisers so I can discover projects to support.  
2. As a **supporter**, I want to pledge to a fundraiser so I can help make a local event happen.  
3. As a **supporter**, I want to choose to pledge anonymously so I can keep my contribution private.  
4. As a **fundraiser owner**, I want to update my fundraiser details so I can keep supporters informed.  
5. As a **fundraiser owner**, I want to close my fundrasier when the funding target is met.
